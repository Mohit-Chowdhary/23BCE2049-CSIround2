Hey!! This is Mohit Chowdhary 23BCE2049, and this is my submission for csi round 2 gamedev domain. 

I've used the Godot game engine to make this game, it isnt 100% complete yet.

What ive completed:

8 directional player movement with appropriate animation( q, w, e, a, s, d, z, x).
Wall collision.
Scoreboard.
End screen.
Random friend placement.

What i have to work on:

Making the actual friends follow, ive unsucessfully tried implementing it multiple times but just cannot figure out how, yet.

Thank you for reading, would love to hear feedback on this.
